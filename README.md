# Weather_Station_Data_Summary
The purpose of this project is to create a code to summarize data collected at different timestamps, that require varying summarization techniques, for use in a modified waterbalance model. 

Data includes temperature (Â°C), relative humidity (%), precipitation (mm), solar irradiance (W/m^2), wind speed (m/s).
All data was collected at an hourly timestamp with the exception of precipitation, which was collected every 10 minutes. 
Data is in .csv format with one file containing all the season's data. Temperature and relative humidity are stored in the same file.
